## auro-carousel use cases

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

## Examples

### Basic

The following example illustrates a the default behavior of the carousel element. Notice how the toggle buttons on the left and the right only appear when there are enough nodes in that direction. This element is fully responsive whereas the l/r toggles will not appear on a mobile device and finger-swipe will operate as expected.

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../../apiExamples/basic.html) -->
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->
</div>

<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./../../apiExamples/basic.html) -->
<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

</auro-accordion>


### Carousel of images w/custom scroll distance

The following example illustrates a the default behavior of the carousel element. Notice how the toggle buttons on the left and the right only appear when there are enough nodes in that direction. This element is fully responsive whereas the l/r toggles will not appear on a mobile device and finger-swipe will operate as expected.

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../../apiExamples/images.html) -->
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->
</div>

<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./../../apiExamples/images.html) -->
<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

</auro-accordion>

## Recommended Use and Version Control

There are two important parts of every Auro component. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">class</a> and the custom clement. The class is exported and then used as part of defining the Web Component. When importing this component as described in the <a href="#install">install</a> section, the class is imported and the `auro-carousel` custom element is defined automatically.

To protect from versioning conflicts with other instances of the component being loaded, it is recommended to use our `registerComponent(name)` method and pass in a unique name.

```js
import './node_modules/@aurodesignsystem/auro-carousel';
registerComponent('custom-carousel');
```

This will create a new custom element that you can use in your HTML that will function identically to the `auro-carousel` element.

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../../apiExamples/custom.html) -->
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->
</div>

<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./../../apiExamples/custom.html) -->
<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

</auro-accordion>
